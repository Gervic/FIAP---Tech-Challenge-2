# Naive Model App

This project implements a naive predictive model that reads data from an Excel file and processes it for predictions.

## Project Structure

```
naive-model-app
├── src
│   ├── main.py          # Entry point of the application
│   └── utils
│       └── file_reader.py # Utility for reading Excel files
├── requirements.txt     # Project dependencies
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd naive-model-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
python src/main.py
```

Make sure to provide the path to your Excel file in the `main.py` script.

## Naive Model Implementation

The naive model is a simple predictive model that makes predictions based on historical data. This project demonstrates how to implement such a model using data read from an Excel file.
